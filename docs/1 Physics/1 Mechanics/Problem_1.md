# Problem 1

1. Theoretical Foundation
Deriving the Governing Equations of Motion:

To analyze projectile motion, we start with the basic principles of kinematics. We consider a projectile launched with an initial velocity ( v_0 ) at an angle ( \theta ) above the horizontal. The motion can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components.

Horizontal Motion: The horizontal component of the initial velocity is given by: [ v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(\theta) ] The horizontal position ( x ) as a function of time ( t ) is: [ x(t) = v_{0x} t = v_0 \cos(\theta) t ]

Vertical Motion: The vertical component of the initial velocity is: [ v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta) ] The vertical position ( y ) as a function of time ( t ) is governed by the equation: [ y(t) = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] where ( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity.

Solving the Equations: To find the time of flight ( T ), we set ( y(T) = 0 ) (assuming the projectile lands at the same height from which it was launched): [ 0 = v_0 \sin(\theta) T - \frac{1}{2} g T^2 ] Factoring out ( T ): [ T \left( v_0 \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2} g T \right) = 0 ] This gives us two solutions: ( T = 0 ) (the launch time) and: [ T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} ]

Finding the Range: The horizontal range ( R ) is given by the horizontal distance traveled during the time of flight: \R = x(T) = v_0 \cos(\theta) T = v_0 \cos(\theta) \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \right) \This simplifies to: [ R = \frac{v_0^2sin(2\theta)}{g} ]

Family of Solutions: The range ( R ) depends on the angle ( \theta ) and the initial velocity ( v_0 ). By varying ( v_0 ) and ( \theta ), we can generate a family of trajectories, illustrating how different initial conditions lead to different ranges.

2. Analysis of the Range
Dependence on Angle of Projection: The range ( R ) is maximized when ( \sin(2\theta) ) is maximized. The maximum value of ( \sin(2\theta) ) is 1, which occurs at ( \theta = 45^\circ ). Thus, for a given initial velocity, the optimal angle for maximum range is ( 45^\circ ).

Influence of Other Parameters:

Initial Velocity ( v_0 ): The range increases with the square of the initial velocity. Doubling the initial velocity results in afold increase in range.
Gravitational Acceleration ( g ): The range is inversely proportional to ( g ). A lower gravitational acceleration (as on the Moon) results in a longer range for the same initial velocity and angle.
3. Practical Applications
Adapting the Model:

Uneven Terrain: The equations can be modified to account for varying launch and landing heights. The time of flight and range would need to be recalculated based on the height difference.
Air Resistance: The simple model assumes no air resistance. To include drag, we would need to solve a more complex set of differential equations, typically requiring numerical methods.
Real-World Examples:

Sports (e.g., soccer, basketball) where the angle of kick or throw significantly affects the distance.
Engineering applications in ballistics and projectile design.
4. Implementation
Computational Tool: To simulate projectile motion, we can create a Python script using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib. Below is a simple implementation:

python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def projectile_motion(v0, theta, g=9.81):
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta)
    T = (2 * v0 * np.sin(theta_rad)) / g  # Time of flight
    t = np.linspace(0, T, num=500)  # Time array

    # Calculate x and y positions
    x = v0 * np.cos(theta_rad) * t
    y = v0 * np.sin(theta_rad) * t - 0.5 * g * t**2

    return x, y

# Parameters
v0 = 50  # Initial velocity in m/s
angles = [15, 30, 45, 60, 75]  # Angles in degrees

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

for angle in angles:
    x, y = projectile_motion(v0, angle)
    plt.plot(x, y, label=f'θ = {angle}°')

plt.title('Projectile Motion: Range vs. Angle of Projection')
plt.xlabel('Horizontal Distance (m)')
plt.ylabel('Vertical Distance (m)')
plt.axhline(0, color='black', lw=0.5, ls='--')
plt.axvline(0, color='black', lw=0.5, ls='--')
plt.grid()
plt.legend()
plt.xlim(0, 200)
plt.ylim(0, 50)
plt.show()
Visualization: This script will generate a plot showing the trajectories of projectiles launched at different angles with the same initial velocity. The resulting graph will illustrate how the angle of projection affects the range and height of the projectile, providing a visual understanding of the underlying physics.
