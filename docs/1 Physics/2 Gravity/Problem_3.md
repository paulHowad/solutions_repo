Introduction
When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its subsequent trajectory is determined by its initial position, velocity, and the gravitational pull of the Earth. Depending on the initial conditions, the payload can follow:
 
- **Elliptical (or circular) orbits:** if its kinetic energy is such that the total energy is negative.
- **Parabolic trajectories:** the borderline case between bound and unbound orbits (zero total energy).
- **Hyperbolic trajectories:** if the payload has more than enough kinetic energy to escape Earth's gravitational field (positive total energy).
 
This document explains the underlying physics, describes a numerical method to simulate the payload motion, and shows how to visualize the different trajectories.
 
## Extended Theoretical Background
 
Understanding the trajectories of a freely released payload near Earth begins with Newton's Law of Gravitation and the conservation laws of energy and angular momentum. Here, we expand on these principles, derive key equations, and explain how they govern orbital motion.
 
### Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Equations of Motion
 
The gravitational force acting on a payload at a distance $r$ from Earth's center is given by
 
$$
\vec{F} = -\frac{\mu}{r^3}\vec{r},
$$
 
where $\mu = GM$ is Earth’s gravitational parameter ($G$ is the gravitational constant and $M$ is the mass of Earth).
 
Using Newton's second law, the acceleration of the payload is:
 
$$
\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{\mu}{r^3}\vec{r}.
$$
 
While these equations can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates, gravity as a central force (always pointing toward the center) is more insightfully described in polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$.
 
### Polar Coordinates and Conservation Laws
 
In polar coordinates, the position vector is represented as:
 
$$
\vec{r} = r \hat{r}.
$$
 
The acceleration in polar coordinates has two components:
 
- **Radial acceleration:**
  
  $$
  \ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{\mu}{r^2},
  $$
 
- **Transverse (angular) acceleration:**
 
  $$
  r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} = 0.
  $$
 
The second equation implies the conservation of angular momentum $L$:
 
$$
L = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}.
$$
 
### Deriving the Orbit Equation
 
Using the conservation of angular momentum, we derive an equation for the shape of the orbit. Introducing the substitution:
 
$$
u = \frac{1}{r},
$$
 
and differentiating with respect to $\theta$:
 
$$
\frac{dr}{d\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^2} \frac{du}{d\theta},
$$
 
the radial acceleration term can be expressed in terms of $u$ and $\theta$. After some manipulation, the radial equation transforms into the differential equation:
 
$$
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{\mu}{L^2}.
$$
 
This linear differential equation has the general solution:
 
$$
u(\theta) = \frac{\mu}{L^2}\left(1 + e\cos(\theta)\right),
$$
 
or equivalently, the orbital equation in polar form:
 
$$
r(\theta) = \frac{L^2/\mu}{1 + e\cos(\theta)}.
$$
 
Here, $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit:
- $0 \leq e < 1$: Elliptical (or circular if $e=0$)
- $e = 1$: Parabolic (the threshold between bound and unbound)
- $e > 1$: Hyperbolic (unbound)
 
### Energy Considerations: The Vis-Viva Equation
 
The specific orbital energy (energy per unit mass) is given by
 
$$
\epsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r},
$$
 
where $v$ is the speed of the payload. The sign of $\epsilon$ determines the type of orbit:
 
- **Elliptical orbits:** $\epsilon < 0$
- **Parabolic trajectory:** $\epsilon = 0$
- **Hyperbolic trajectory:** $\epsilon > 0$
 
For a given orbit, the vis-viva equation relates the velocity $v$ at any distance $r$ to the semi-major axis $a$:
 
$$
v^2 = \mu\left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right).
$$
 
For a circular orbit ($r = a$), this simplifies to:
 
$$
v_{\text{circ}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}},
$$
 
and the escape velocity (the speed needed for a parabolic trajectory) is:
 
$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r}}.
$$
 
### Effective Potential and Radial Motion
 
Another way to analyze orbital motion is through the effective potential. The total energy in the radial direction, considering the conservation of angular momentum, can be expressed as:
 
$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}\dot{r}^2 + V_{\text{eff}}(r),
$$
 
where the effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}(r)$ is defined as:
 
$$
V_{\text{eff}}(r) = -\frac{\mu}{r} + \frac{L^2}{2r^2}.
$$
 
- The first term represents gravitational potential energy.
- The second term represents the "centrifugal" potential energy due to the payload's angular momentum.
 
The effective potential provides insight into radial stability. The minimum of $V_{\text{eff}}(r)$ corresponds to a stable circular orbit, while deviations lead to oscillatory changes in $r$, characteristic of elliptical orbits.
 
### Connecting Initial Conditions to Orbit Types
 
The initial position and velocity determine both the specific energy $\epsilon$ and the angular momentum $L$:
 
- **Circular Orbit:** The velocity is exactly $v_{\text{circ}}$, balancing gravitational pull and centripetal force for a constant $r$.
- **Elliptical Orbit:** A velocity lower than $v_{\text{circ}}$ results in an elliptical path with varying $r$.
- **Hyperbolic Trajectory:** A velocity exceeding $v_{\text{esc}}$ results in a positive energy orbit, allowing the payload to escape Earth’s gravitational influence.
 
### Summary
 
The trajectory of a payload released near Earth is governed by:
- **Gravitational forces:** As described by Newton’s law.
- **Conservation of angular momentum:** Leading to the derivation of the orbit equation.
- **Energy considerations:** Classifying orbits as elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic based on the specific orbital energy.
- **Effective potential:** Providing insight into the stability of orbits.
 
This theoretical framework forms the basis for designing simulations and computational tools to predict payload trajectories for space missions.

## Numerical Simulation
 
Below are two separate simulation scenarios for comparison. The left side shows **Scenario 1 (200 km Altitude)** and the right side shows **Scenario 2 (400 km Altitude)**. In Scenario 1, the payload is released from 200 km altitude with:
 
- **Circular Orbit:**  
  \( v = \sqrt{\mu/(R_{\text{earth}}+200\,\text{km})} \)
- **Elliptical / Reentry:**  
  \( v = 0.8 \times v_{\text{circ}} \) (which leads to reentry)
- **Hyperbolic Trajectory:**  
  \( v = 1.1 \times v_{\text{esc}} \)
 
In Scenario 2, the payload is released from 400 km altitude with:
 
- **Circular Orbit:**  
  \( v = \sqrt{\mu/(R_{\text{earth}}+400\,\text{km})} \)
- **Elliptical Orbit:**  
  \( v = 0.9 \times v_{\text{circ}} \) (producing a stable, bound elliptical orbit)
- **Hyperbolic Trajectory:**  
  \( v = 1.1 \times v_{\text{esc}} \)

#### Explanation of the Code (Scenario 1)
 
1. **Dynamics Function:**  
   The dynamics function computes the derivatives of the state vector \([x, y, vx, vy]\) using Newton’s law of gravitation, \(\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\mu \vec{r}/r^3\).
 
2. **Simulation Function:**  
   The simulate_trajectory function sets up the initial state and integrates the equations over the defined time span using the solve_ivp solver. The collision event stops the integration when the payload intersects Earth’s surface.
 
3. **Initial Conditions:**                                                           
    - The payload is assumed to be released from a position 200 km above Earth's surface.
     - Three initial velocity cases are defined:
        - **Circular orbit:** using the circular velocity \(v_{\text{circ}} = \sqrt{\mu / r}\).
        - **Elliptical trajectory:** using 80% of the circular velocity.
        - **Hyperbolic trajectory:** using 110% of the escape velocity \(v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{2\mu / r}\).
 
4. **Plotting:**  
   The code normalizes positions by Earth's radius to display Earth as a unit circle. Each trajectory is plotted in the \(xy\)-plane.

#### Output Explanation (Scenario 1)
 
- **Blue Circle (Earth):**  
  Represents Earth as a unit circle. The payload is released at approximately 1.03 Earth radii.

## Exploring the Oberth Effect at Periapsis
 
In this simulation, we compare two cases of a payload initially in an elliptical orbit having a periapsis at 300 km and an apogee at 600 km altitude. We consider:
 
- **Case 1 (No Burn):** The payload follows the baseline elliptical orbit.
- **Case 2 (With Burn):** At periapsis—where the payload is moving fastest—a small impulsive burn is applied (adding, for example, 100 m/s to the tangential velocity). This extra energy raises the apogee significantly, thereby demonstrating the Oberth effect.

## Explanation of the Code
 
- **Orbital Parameters and Initial Conditions:**                                        
    - **Altitudes:**  
    The periapsis is set at 300 km and the apogee at 600 km above Earth’s surface. These values are converted into radii by adding them to Earth's radius.
    - **Periapsis Velocity Calculation:**  
    The velocity at periapsis is computed with:
    $$
    v_p = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu \, r_a}{r_p (r_a + r_p)}}
    $$
    This calculation ensures that the baseline elliptical orbit will have the specified periapsis and apogee.
    - **Impulsive Burn:**  
    A delta‑$V$ of 100 m/s is applied at periapsis for the second case. Two initial state vectors are defined:
     - **No Burn (Baseline):** $[r_p, 0, 0, v_p]$
     - **With Burn:** $[r_p, 0, 0, v_p + \Delta V]$
 
- **Dynamics and Numerical Integration:**                                                                      
    - **Dynamics Function:**  
    The `dynamics` function calculates the acceleration using Newton’s law of gravitation:
    $$
    \ddot{x} = -\frac{\mu x}{r^3}, \quad \ddot{y} = -\frac{\mu y}{r^3}
    $$
    - **Event Function:**  
    The `collision_event` function halts the integration if the payload reaches Earth's surface (i.e., when  $r = R_{\text{earth}}$).
    - **Integration:**  
    Both trajectories are simulated over a 6000-second window using `solve_ivp` with a tight relative tolerance of $1 \times 10^{-8}$ to ensure accuracy.
 
- **Plotting:**                                                                       
    - **Earth Representation:**  
    Earth is plotted as a blue filled circle after normalizing positions by Earth's radius, so it appears as a unit circle.
    - **Trajectory Plotting:**  
    The baseline elliptical orbit (no burn) is plotted in green, and the orbit after the impulsive burn is plotted in red.
    - **Additional Plot Elements:**  
    Labels for the axes, a title, and a legend are included to clarify the two different scenarios.

1. **Visualization Context:**                   
    - **Normalized Display:**  
     The plot displays Earth as a blue filled unit circle since all distances are normalized by Earth's radius.
    - **Starting Point:**  
     The simulation begins at a periapsis of 300 km (roughly $1.05\,R_{\text{earth}}$), which places the orbits near Earth’s surface on the normalized scale.
 
2. **Baseline Orbit (No Burn):**                
    - **Green Curve:**  
     The green curve represents the elliptical orbit with a periapsis at 300 km and an apogee at 600 km. This orbit follows the intended path without any modifications.
 
3. **Orbit with Impulsive Burn (Oberth Effect):**                                   
    - **Red Curve:**  
     The red curve shows the orbit after a 100 m/s impulsive burn is applied at periapsis.
    - **Effect of the Burn:**  
     The burn, performed at the point of highest orbital speed, efficiently increases the orbital energy due to the Oberth effect. This results in a significantly higher apogee compared to the baseline elliptical orbit.
    - **Visual Distinction:**  
     Although the altitude differences are small relative to Earth's overall size, the divergence between the red and green curves clearly illustrates the impact of the impulsive burn.
 
4. **General Observations:**                    
    - The simulation demonstrates that impulsive burns executed at periapsis are highly effective, as the added delta‑$V$ results in a markedly altered orbit with a raised apogee.
    - Modifying the value of $\Delta V$ or changing the orbital parameters would result in more pronounced visual differences.
