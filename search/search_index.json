Maximum Range: The maximum range occurs at an angle of ( 45^\\circ ). Effect of Initial Velocity: As the initial velocity increases, the range increases for all angles of projection. Graphical Representation: The following plots illustrate the relationship between the angle of projection and the range for different initial velocities. Python Code for Simulation and Visualization Here\u2019s the complete Python code that calculates and visualizes the range of a projectile as a function of the angle of projection: python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Constants g = 9.81 # Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2) Function to calculate range def calculate_range(v0, theta): return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * np.radians(theta))) / g Parameters v0_values = [10, 20, 30] # Initial velocities in m/s theta = np.linspace(0, 90, 180) # Angles from 0 to 90 degrees Plotting plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for v0 in v0_values: R = calculate_range(v0, theta) plt.plot(theta, R, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s') plt.title('Range of a Projectile as a Function of the Angle of Projection') plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (meters)') plt.axhline(0, color='black', lw=0.5, ls='--') plt.axvline(45, colorred', lw=0.5, ls='--', label='Max Range at 45\u00b0') plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.xlim(0, 90) plt.ylim(0, max(calculate_range(max(v0_values), theta)) * 1.1) plt.show() Graphical Output When you run the above code, you will see a plot similar to the one below (the actual plot will be generated by executing the code): Range of a as a Function of the Angle of Projection Conclusion The graph clearly shows how the range varies with the angle of projection for different initial velocities. The peak of each curve occurs at ( 45^\\circ ), confirming that this angle provides the maximum range for a given initial velocity. As the initial velocity increases, the range increases for all angles, demonstrating the direct relationship between initial velocity and range. Limitations and Future Work This model assumes no air resistance and a flat launch surface. Future work could include simulations that account for air resistance and varying launch heights to provide a more realistic model of projectile motion.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#constants","text":"g = 9.81 # Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)","title":"Constants"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#function-to-calculate-range","text":"def calculate_range(v0, theta): return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * np.radians(theta))) / g","title":"Function to calculate range"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#parameters","text":"v0_values = [10, 20, 30] # Initial velocities in m/s theta = np.linspace(0, 90, 180) # Angles from 0 to 90 degrees","title":"Parameters"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#plotting","text":"plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for v0 in v0_values: R = calculate_range(v0, theta) plt.plot(theta, R, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s') plt.title('Range of a Projectile as a Function of the Angle of Projection') plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (meters)') plt.axhline(0, color='black', lw=0.5, ls='--') plt.axvline(45, colorred', lw=0.5, ls='--', label='Max Range at 45\u00b0') plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.xlim(0, 90) plt.ylim(0, max(calculate_range(max(v0_values), theta)) * 1.1) plt.show() Graphical Output When you run the above code, you will see a plot similar to the one below (the actual plot will be generated by executing the code): Range of a as a Function of the Angle of Projection Conclusion The graph clearly shows how the range varies with the angle of projection for different initial velocities.
